This driver interfers with the USB cdc-acm driver. Therefore, you will have to
blacklist it. You can do this by adding an entry "blacklist cdc-acm" into one of
the files in /etc/modprobe.d.

Also, it is useful to add "i2c-devantech-iss" to /etc/modules to ensure that the
driver is loaded automatically during system startup to ensure that the device
is detected as I2C master controller.

To build and install this driver, execute the following command sequence:

$ make
$ sudo make install

If you get an error message such as

make: *** /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server: No such file or directory.
Stop.
make: *** [modules] Error 2

you will have to install the correct version of the linux header files. In
Ubuntu, and with above error message, this would be

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server
